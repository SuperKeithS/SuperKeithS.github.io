I am a fellow data enthusiast, trying to find meaning in the wild world of data.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology. I first started working in data science(Particularly in R) as a niche for my job in a research lab. While we had applications to perform statistic, no one in the lab really understood them(other than what they needed to get by). I decided to fill that void by developing my statistical understanding.


While on the path of learning I ran into the R programming language. At first I had very limited programming knowledge(college course in C++) but once I started learning the language more and started utilizing it, I really began to appreciate and respect the field I've come to know as data science.

I have many pet projects in development and I hope I get a chance to share them with you on this site.
